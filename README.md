## Instructions

These CSS files are snippets to be applied on top of @kepano 's [minimal theme](https://github.com/kepano/obsidian-minimal)

You can find the individual snippets in the `./snippets` folder, or you can use one of these combined snippets:

You'll need to install the [boxicon font](https://unpkg.com/boxicons@2.0.7/fonts/boxicons.ttf) to use the `cc-boxicons` snippet and any of the combined snippets.

1. `california-coast.default.css`: Uses the default system font for the editor
2. `california-coast.inter.css`: Uses the Inter font for the editor
   - **Note**: it is recommended to install the the [variable version of Inter](https://rsms.me/inter/)
3. `california-coast.lora.css`: Uses the [Lora](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Lora) font for the editor. Lora must be installed on your system for this to work.

**Note**: These snippets were designed to be used with the [hider plugin](https://github.com/kepano/obsidian-hider) and the [sliding panes plugin](https://github.com/deathau/sliding-panes-obsidian). They may work fine without them, but may also have issues.
