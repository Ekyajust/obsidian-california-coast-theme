## Instructions

These CSS files are snippets to be applied on top of @kepano 's [minimal theme](https://github.com/kepano/obsidian-minimal)

They also rely on the [hider plugin](https://github.com/kepano/obsidian-hider) and the [sliding panes plugin](https://github.com/deathau/sliding-panes-obsidian).

You'll also need to install the variable version of the [Inter font](https://rsms.me/inter/) and the [boxicon font](https://unpkg.com/boxicons@2.0.7/fonts/boxicons.ttf)
